# BluePay Banking Performance Dashboard
## Project Background
  As a data analyst for **BluePay**, a full-service banking company based in Melbourne, Australia, I developed a comprehensive dashboard designed to provide key stakeholders with an at-a-glance view of essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This dashboard serves as a central hub for multiple departments, enabling decision-making and performance optimization powered by data.

  The dashboard is structured into three core categories: Transactions, Users, and Cards, with each section offering in-depth metrics and drill-down capabilities tailored for diverse business needs. These include industry performance evaluation, spending pattern analysis, customer financial insights, and business intelligence forecasting.

  The primary objective of this system is to deliver real-time insights into BluePay’s banking operations while maintaining an intuitive and user-friendly interface. By analyzing transaction volumes and values, credit card usage trends, and customer profiles, this dashboard empowers teams to refine strategies, enhance customer engagement, and drive business growth.

## Executive Summary
  As of today, **BluePay’s overall transaction volume and value across all industries remain consistent with historical performance from the previous year.** The bank has recorded 8% growth in the number of transactions and a 0.11% increase in total transaction value, with an **upward trend projected over the next 20 months**.

  BluePay currently serves **1.2K+ unique users**, a figure aligned with previous fiscal years. The majority of customers maintain a strong average credit score (700+), while transaction growth is primarily driven by clients in the $15K–$20K credit bracket. Tenured customers have maintained steady spending patterns, whereas **new customers are contributing to a gradual upward trend in transaction volume**. In terms of payment preferences, **Mastercard leads the market** with over 50% share, while **debit cards dominate** as the preferred payment type (70%+ usage). **Online transactions** continue to outperform all other channels, surpassing in-person purchases by as much as **80% across various industries**. 
  
  While individual industries experience periodic fluctuations, **BluePay remains in a strong financial position, with stable transaction movement and continued growth opportunities.**
